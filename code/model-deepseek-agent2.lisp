;;; in the agent, arbitrary helper functions may be defined
;;; using Common Lisp, but also all add-ons of the SBCL lisp
;;; system, in particular loading shared libraries and calling
;;; functions in those libraries.
;;; For details, see SBCL manual regarding its alien function interace
;;; or have a look into geomates.lisp which connects to a C library
;;;
;;; Additionally, you can use run-program to call any external software.
;;; Note that the process will be run in a null environment by default, so
;;; all pathnames must be explicit. To handle different locations, a simple
;;; "or" may be all it takes:
